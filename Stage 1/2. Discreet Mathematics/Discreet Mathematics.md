> [!roseframe] **Info**
> You will study **logic** and **set theory** in an introductory discrete mathematics. The concepts you learnt here will play a key role in your later studies and ***improve your thinking skill.***
> 
> You will also study proofs, functions (injective, surjective, bijective inverse), introductory graph theory and number theory, Euclid's algorithm, discrete probability (counting, nCr, nPr) etc in this course.

# Footnotes

[^1]: Don't misinterpret the word naive, though he propose the honest title as An Outline of the Elements of Naive Set Theory. This is not those books for dummies nor complete idiot's guide. Set theory plays a significant role in mathematics, if you are serious about it. Halmos is one of the better expositors of mathematics.
[^2]: Let me warn you: proof is a crucial, I repeat, crucial, part in higher mathematics. Velleman did a good job for beginners here.
[^3]: I enjoy reading Epp's text when I first learn this topic. At this stage, some author makes good effort to spark student's interest. Don't forget to check out the errata.
[^4]: Another nice introductory text on this topic. See the companion website.
