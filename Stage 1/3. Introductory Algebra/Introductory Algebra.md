# Introductory Algebra

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Complex number, polynomials, matrix, system of equation, Gaussian elimination, vector space, linear transformation, etc.**
> 
> **T.M. Aposotol's Calculus Vol. 1 in the calculus sections also introduce topics that is relevant to this area.**  
>   
> **A few Americans (exchanged to Sydney) in my third year abstract algebra class told us they couldn't follow because they haven't learnt much complex number. In order to have fun with linear algebra and complex variables in stage 2, it's better to learn complex number now.**

# Footnotes

[^1]: The application version introduced how linear algebra can be applied to Markov Chains, Graph Theory, Games of Strategy, Computer Graphics, Fractals, Chaos, Cryptography, Genetics, etc.
[^2]: Read Chapter n's, for all positive integer n<8.
[^3]: Leave Chapter 6 and 7 to the next stage.
[^4]: He's a member of the Bourbaki and wrote many books. Not friendly for beginners, but you should get use to it.
