# Calculus

## Introductory Real Analysis, Several Variables Calculus, Vector Calculus, etc):

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Learn the very basic concept of real analysis, like open set, close set, boundary point, closure, limit point, bounded set, connected set, compact set, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. To get yourself ready for the stage 3 analysis, make sure you understand those stuff. Next, the Lagrange multiplier, inverse and implicit function theorems can also be studied. For the several variables section, gradients, double, triple and surface integrals, cylindrical coordinates, Green's theorem and divergence theorem are the key things. Also learn basic Fourier series.**

# Footnotes

[^1]: The author is a fan of Rudin and he was trying to bridge between less rigorousX books and hard-edged classical books like baby Rudin.
[^2]: Very friendly, aimed particularly for non-mathematicians who need to study this hardest ever course (the author means analysis) in their life.
