# Complex Variables (Introductory Complex Analysis)

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Another beautiful branch of mathematics. While you're in high school, you may wonder what's the point of introducing imaginary number `i`, does it really exists? Is it really useful? In an introductory complex analysis course, you will see the beauty of this construction. Gauss, Riemann, Weierstrass and Cauchy are key figures in this area.**
> 
> Key concepts to learn are: *analytic functions*, *Cauchy-Riemann equations*, *contour integral*, *Cauchy-Goursat theorem*, *residues* and *poles*.
