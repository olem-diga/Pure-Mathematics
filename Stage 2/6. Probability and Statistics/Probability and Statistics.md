<h1> Probability and Statistics</h1>

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Well, being a well educated mathematician, you should have basic knowledge of statistics. Things to learn: basic probability theory (independent events, conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem), random variables (r.v.), expectation, convergence of r.v., maximum likelihood estimator, basic hypothesis testing, p-values are the basic. 
> If you want to go a bit further, check out linear regression, linear model, residual, categorical predictors, logistic regression, ANOVA (analysis of variance) etc.**
