> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Mathematics program in the University are constructed in the way that courses are offered in favor of other schools (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, Economic, etc). For example, Physics students have to take linear algebra, several variable calculus, mathematical analysis and differential equation. As a consequence, textbooks are written and catalog like the following way. Several authors focus on the application and often do calculation without justifying, beware of it.**

- [ ] [[Linear Algebra]]
- [ ] [[Introductory Higher Algebra]]
- [ ] [[Calculus]]
- [ ] [[Complex Variables (Introductory Complex Analysis)]]
- [ ] [[Differential Equation]]
- [ ] [[Probability and Statistics]]
- [ ] [[Second Course in Statistics]]
