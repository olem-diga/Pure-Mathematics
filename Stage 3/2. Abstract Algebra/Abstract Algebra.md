# Footnotes

[^1]: 'Numbers measure size, groups measure symmetry,' said the author. This book deals with several topics, which introductory abstract algebra texts usually skip, like Platonic solid and wallpaper patterns.
[^2]: Not aimed at this level, but this is the one you like to keep in your own library. As M. Artin states in "A Note for the Teacher" that several sections would make a coherent course, you may simply follow his list at this stage. My lecturer recommended this partly because M. Artin was his supervisor, I recommend this but I have no direct relationship with M. Artin.
