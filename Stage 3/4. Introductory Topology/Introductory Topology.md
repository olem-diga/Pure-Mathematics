# Introductory Topology

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Topology is an extension of geometry and built on set theory, it's about continuity. There is a joke that topologists are those who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup. Wikipedia has a .gif to demonstrate this. You may have studied open sets, open neighbourhood, interior, closure, boundary, basis, continuity, compactness and connectedness etc. in the analysis course, move on to homemorphism, homotopy and fundamental group.**
> 
> **As in abstract algebra and analysis, several selected books or notes cover more than enough. You may leave a few sections to study at the next stage.**

# Footnotes

[^1]: It's like lecture notes, many proofs are left as exercises and many exercises are proofs.
[^2]: Very nice introduction to the metric spaces, topological spaces, connectedness and compactness. Recommended for first reading.
[^3]: Another nice introduction. Go further than Mendelson's one. Also cover topics like the Tychonoff theorem, metrization theorems, complete metric spaces and function spaces, the fundamental group and covering spaces.
