# Statistical Inference

> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Build upon stage 2 statistics, you will learn here the Cramer-Rao bound, uniform minimum variance unbiased estimators, Neyman-Pearson theory, Bayesian inference, basic bootstrap and robustness, introductory non-parametric (including the sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, McNemar's chi-square test, Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-samples test, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks, Spearman's R and Kendal's Tau), etc. Note a few texts say they are aimed at graduated level, partly because people from other fields only learn this material in graduated schools, as a result the texts have to set up basic probability and statistics (stage 2 stuff) for them.**

# Footnotes

[^1]: Detail explanation. Common misconceptions are mentioned, for example: "Probability Zero Does Not Mean Impossible" (p.17) and Statistical Swindles (p.45).
[^2]: Made a few good comments, but perhaps too concise as a textbook. Can be served as a reference. Unlike the rest recommended texts for this course, stage 2 probability and statistics is the assumed knowledge for this text.
[^3]: As my lecturer Spiridon Penev have said, this text is a bit outdated but it contains useful exercise problems.
