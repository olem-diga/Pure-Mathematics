# Probability and Stochastic (Random) Processes


> [!roseframe] **Info**
> **Conditional expectation, Poisson process, Markov chains, renewal theory, queueing theory, reliability theory, Brownian motion and stationary processes. This topic is particularly useful for electrical and computer engineers, actuarial study, finance or things like that. See also left material from stage 2 probability. If you want to learn this with measure, see stage 4 probability list.**

# Footnotes

[^1]: "A colorful and rich introduction to probability theory and its applications" according to Karlin and Taylor, but it "is limited in that it deals only with discrete probabilities."
[^2]: Note this is an introduction to probability and stochastic processes, not an introduction to basic probability theory. This text could be quite hard to follow without knowing very basic probability theory. Also note that, no graph has been used when the author introduce Markov chains for the first time.
