# Footnotes

[^1]: "What every young analyst should know" was the originally intended title. Morse-Kelley set theory was introduced in this book.
[^2]: One quote by Ian Stewart is sufficient. "This book is in the top ten for books conveying the dreadful secret that mathematics is fascinating."
[^3]: Contains dozens of historical material.
[^4]: Very beautiful book.
[^5]: Lefschetz developed new result in this monograph.
[^6]: An appendix by John W. Morgan on the work of Grigory Perelman is included in the 2007 Dover edition.
[^7]: More advanced work, influential. Notes taken by M. Spivak and R. Wells.
