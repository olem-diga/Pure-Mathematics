# Footnotes

[^1]: As Evans emphasise, PDE is not a branch of functional analysis; many interesting equations are non-linear; understanding generalised solutions is fundamental; good theory is as useful as exact formulas; and this is a textbook, not a reference book.
[^2]: The author's principle: "Motivate with physics but then do mathematics."
