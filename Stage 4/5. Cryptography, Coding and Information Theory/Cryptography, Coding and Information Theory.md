# Footnotes

[^1]: If you are serious about this field (I mean you are not merely interested in cracking ciphers like those the Zodiac Killer used), you must learn Hamming error correcting codes, this is the origin.
[^2]: Take a look, and give me a reason why you shouldn't download it if you are studying this subject.
[^3]: More advanced text, basic abstract algebra required.
