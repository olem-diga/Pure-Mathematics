# Footnotes

[^1]: Nicolas Bourbaki is a group of French mathematician aimed to write rigour mathematic which based on set theory. Not recommended for a beginner, but if you like, search around for topics.
[^2]: Classic.
[^3]: Originally envisioned as new editions of his Lectures, the main difference is that category theory was not yet developed when he was preparing the previous version.
[^4]: My first Springer GTM. Only a few of us dare to ignore it. Ignoring it may look cool, but I'm not going to do so. To quote an Amazon customer, 'this will teach you how to run if you know how to walk.' Some readers think that if one wanna study algebraic number theory, one should be comfortable with Lang's Algebra first. See George M. Bergman's Companion.
[^5]: For historical interest, perhaps.
[^6]: Non-standard treatment.
