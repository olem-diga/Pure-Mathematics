### About this article:

This list is written for those who want to learn mathematics but have no idea how to start. Yup, a list for beginners. I don't claim that this list makes you a good pure mathematician, since I belong to the complement of good pure mathematician. I make no attempt to define what pure mathematics is, but hopefully it will be clear as you proceed. I also highlighted several books that you would really like to keep in your own library. You probably like to read those books again and again in your life. Free material excluded.  

Note the highlighted list does NOT indicate those books are good for beginners. I shall try to keep this list up to date whenever I exist.
### Assumed knowledge:

I assumed you have high school mathematics background (i.e. basic trigonometry, Euclidean geometry, etc). 

The aim of this page is to introduce what different branches of mathematics are; and recommended a few notes or texts.
### Time:

It takes approximately one year for each stage (except for stage 4, I list more material in each field for more advanced studies), for a full time student. Part time students may double the time. But its better for anyone to understand most parts of stage n before proceeding to n+1, for some integer n in {1, 2, 3, 4}.

If you decided to attend a class, don't expect the professor can teach, it always happen, especially in higher level courses.  
  
What's the order of courses to study within a stage doesn't really matter, usually. One doesn't need to read every listed book within a subject to master the subject. I listed more than enough so that you can scout around to find one that you feel comfortable with. Some people like to consult a few books, beware of the symbols from different books in such cases.  

Moreover, it often happens that you couldn't solve a problem within an hour. It's not surprise to spend a week or more to tackle one problem. Things may come to your head suddenly. Shouting eureka is the high point of a mathematician.
### Axiom of choice

My selection will not be bounded by any publication press, author's nationality or religion. It relies on two factors: well written or cheap.
These two factors are not mutually exclusive. I treat "free" as an element in "cheap".

Bear in mind that, just because one is a good mathematician doesn't imply he's a good author or educator. Perhaps Terry Tao is an exceptional case. To study science, reading the classics is optional. While for literature or philosophy, I wonder if any well educated student has never study Shakespeare or Plato.
